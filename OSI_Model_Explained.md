# OSI Model Explained

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network communications between computers. It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions.

## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model

7. **Application Layer**
   - Closest to the end user; provides network services to applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

6. **Presentation Layer**
   - Translates data formats, encrypts/decrypts, and compresses data.
   - Ensures data is readable by the receiving system.
   - Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII.

5. **Session Layer**
   - Manages sessions or connections between applications.
   - Controls dialog, synchronization, and session recovery.
   - Examples: APIs, sockets.

4. **Transport Layer**
   - Ensures reliable data transfer with error recovery and flow control.
   - Segments and reassembles data.
   - Examples: TCP, UDP.

3. **Network Layer**
   - Handles routing of data between devices across different networks.
   - Manages logical addressing (IP addresses).
   - Examples: Routers, IPv4/IPv6.

2. **Data Link Layer**
   - Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction.
   - Organizes bits into frames.
   - Examples: MAC addresses, switches.

1. **Physical Layer**
   - Deals with the physical connection between devices.
   - Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium (cables, switches).
   - Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics.


## Why Learn the OSI Model?

- Helps troubleshoot network issues by isolating problems to specific layers.
- Provides a universal language for networking professionals.
- Guides the design and development of network protocols and devices.
